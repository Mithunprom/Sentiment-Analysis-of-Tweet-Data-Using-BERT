# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweet-Data-Using-BERT
This project is about using the sentiment analysis of the tweet data by using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).
Tweete sentiment, which includes an array of subtasks
on inferring the affectual state of a person from
their tweet. Only the English tweets are modeled in this project. although it can be easily extendes for other languages that described by <a href="SemEval2018-Task1-task-description.pdf">Saif <i>et al.</i>(2008)</a>. This method outperform any other state of the art techniques for this datasets. However, stacking a multilayer BERT can furthur improve the performance, which will be for the future task.
